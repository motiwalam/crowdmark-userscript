# Crowdmark Userscript

Paste the contents of `script.js` into the browser developer window after logging into Crowdmark.

Run `await getCompleteSummary()` to get a summary of class performance for every assignment in every course. 

Run `await getAllPerfReports()` to get the "performance reports" for every class; this information can sometimes be different from the above (for reasons I don't understand).
